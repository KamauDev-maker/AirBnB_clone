## Descripton of the project
The goal of the project is to deploy a clone of [AirBnB Website](https://www.airbnb.com/ "AirBnB Website") using my server. The final version of this project will have:
- A command interpreter to manipulate data without a visual interface, like a shell(perfect for development and debugging).
- A website (the front-end) that shows the final product to everybody: static and dynamic.
- A database or files that store data (data = objects).
- An API that provides a communication interface between the front-end and your data (retrieve, create, delete, update them).
## Getting Started
To start the command interpreter type in these commands in your terminal:
```bash
Cloning the repo and starting the console:
================================
git clone https://github.com/KamauDev-maker/AirBnB_clone.git
cd AirBnB_clone
```
## Execution
Your shell should work like this in interactive mode:
```bash
$ ./console.py
(hbnb) help
Documented commands (type help <topic>):
================================
EOF help quit
(hbnb)
(hbnb)
(hbnb) quit
$
```
Also in non-interactive mode: (like the Shell project in C)
```bash
$  echo "help" | ./console.py
(hbnb)
Documented commands (type help <topic>):
================================
EOF help quit
(hbnb)
$
$ cat test_help
help
$
$ cat test_help | ./console.py
(hbnb)
Documented commands (type help <topic>):
==============================
EOF help quit
(hbnb)
$
```
